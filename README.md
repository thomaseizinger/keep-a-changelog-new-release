# Keep A Changelog - New Release

This GitHub action will update your CHANGELOG.md for a new release:

- Changes the 'unreleased' section to the new version
- Updates the links to the tags at the end of the file
- Inserts a new 'unreleased' section at the top

Here is a diff from one of the [test cases](./__tests__/fixtures/standard):

## Usage

Within a workflow, you can use it like this:

```yaml
name: "..."
on: ...

jobs:
  update-changelog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Update changelog
      uses: thomaseizinger/keep-a-changelog-new-release@v1
      with:
        tag: v0.6.0 # You probably want to have this dynamic :)
```

The action will do nothing else apart from modifying the changelog.
It neither creates a commit, nor does it push anything to anywhere.
You will have to do that as part of your workflow if you need this behaviour.
